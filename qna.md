our background and why you participated


Which dataset you chose and why (what is the business problem: 1-2 slides)


My name is Navpreet Singh and I am from Punjab. I worked as a Security Engineer for 2 years, then I moved into backend development for 3 years. Currently, I am working at Turing for Google.

I created Dash to provide everyone with a personalized AI agent that remembers your preferences, learns from interactions, and takes meaningful actions on your behalf. My vision is an AI that truly works for you and evolves with you, transforming how we interact with technology and manage our digital lives.

I chose restaurant data; using that, we can find restaurants for dine-in or online food orders and analyse dishes or menus

I wrote a few custom migrations to import JSON into ArangoDB because NetworkX was not able to import multiple node and edge types.

I Cleanup the data, the wrote the custom code with parrallel processing to import faster





the steps taken to persist/load the data into ArangoDB if you provided the data set.
